      WELCOME TO RADMC-3D: A 3-D CONTINUUM AND LINE RT SOLVER    
                                                                 
        This is the 3-D reincarnation of the 2-D RADMC code      
                (c) 2010/2015 Cornelis Dullemond                 
                                                                 
 ************* NOTE: THIS IS STILL A BETA VERSION ***************
 ****** Some modes/capabilities are not yet ready/mature ********
                                                                 
       Please feel free to ask questions. Also please report     
        bugs and/or suspicious behavior without hestitation.     
      The reliability of this code depends on your vigilance!

 Number of processors:           16
 Number of threads in use:           10
 Reading global frequencies/wavelengths...
 Reading grid file and prepare grid tree...
    Adjusting theta(ny+1) to exactly pi/2...
 Reading star data...
 Note: Please be aware that you treat the star(s) as
       point source(s) while using spherical coordinate mode.
       Since R_*<<R_in this is probably OK, but if you want
       to play safe, then set istar_sphere = 1 in radmc3d.inp.
 Note: Star 1 is taken to be a blackbody star
       at a temperature T = 3298. Kelvin
 Grid information (current status):
   We have 9900 branches, of which 9900 are actual grid cells.
   ---> 100.000% mem use for branches, and 100.000% mem use for actual cells.
   No grid refinement is active. The AMR tree is not allocated (this saves memory).
 Reading the heat source spatial distribution...
 ALWAYS SELF-CHECK FOR NOW...
 Using mirror symmetry in equatorial plane, because max(theta)==pi/2.
 Beware: The OpenMP-parallel acceleration of RADMC-3D has 
         not yet been tested with all of the modes and
         features that RADMC-3D offers. Please check 
         your parallel results against the serial version
         (i.e. compiling without -fopenmp). 
 Reading dust data...
 Note: Opacity file dustkappa_0.inp does not cover the 
       complete wavelength range of the model (i.e. the range
       in the file frequency.inp or wavelength_micron.inp).
       Range of model:     lambda = [ 0.10E+00, 0.10E+06]
       Range in this file: lambda = [ 0.10E+00, 0.10E+06]
       Simple extrapolations are used to extend this range.
 Note: Opacity file dustkappa_1.inp does not cover the 
       complete wavelength range of the model (i.e. the range
       in the file frequency.inp or wavelength_micron.inp).
       Range of model:     lambda = [ 0.10E+00, 0.10E+06]
       Range in this file: lambda = [ 0.10E+00, 0.10E+06]
       Simple extrapolations are used to extend this range.
 Reading dust densities...
 Dust mass in species            1  =   4.65416145708222838E-003  Msun
 Dust mass in species            2  =   1.06442521332775620E-003  Msun
 Dust mass total =   5.71858667040998480E-003  Msun
